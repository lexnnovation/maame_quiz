# Officer Test Portal

A single-use-access-code knowledge test portal for customer service officers, plus an admin
dashboard to manage officers, questions, settings, and a live audit log.

Next.js (App Router) + SQLite (`better-sqlite3`). All quiz logic — question order, answer
shuffling, correct answers, and scoring — lives server-side; the client only ever receives the
current question's text and shuffled option labels, never the answer key.

## Local development

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local
# edit .env.local and set SESSION_SECRET (openssl rand -base64 32)
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 for the officer flow, http://localhost:3000/admin for the admin
dashboard. The first admin visit prompts you to set a passcode (hashed with bcrypt and stored in
SQLite — there's no default/backdoor passcode).

The SQLite file is created at `./data/app.db` (configurable via `DATA_DIR`).

## Deploying to Coolify (Hetzner)

This repo ships a multi-stage `Dockerfile` (Next.js `output: standalone`), so Coolify's
**Dockerfile** build pack is all you need — no Nixpacks, no separate database service.

1. **Push this repo** to a git host Coolify can reach (GitHub/GitLab/Gitea, or your own Coolify
   git instance).
2. In Coolify: **New Resource → Application**, pick the repo/branch, and set the build pack to
   **Dockerfile**.
3. **Set environment variables** on the resource:
   - `SESSION_SECRET` — required, random string ≥32 chars. Generate with
     `openssl rand -base64 32`. Rotating this logs every admin out.
   - `DATA_DIR` — leave as `/app/data` (matches the volume mount below).
   - Coolify sets `PORT` automatically; the Dockerfile also defaults it to `3000`.
4. **Add a persistent volume**: mount path `/app/data`. This is where `app.db` (officers,
   questions, settings, admin passcode hash) lives — without this volume, a redeploy wipes all
   data.
5. Set the **FQDN/domain** for the app in Coolify. Coolify's Traefik layer handles HTTPS
   (Let's Encrypt) automatically once the domain's DNS points at your Hetzner server.
6. Deploy. Coolify will build the image from the `Dockerfile`, run it, and use the container's
   built-in `HEALTHCHECK` (`GET /api/health`) to know when it's ready.
7. Visit `https://<your-domain>/admin` once and set the admin passcode — this only works the
   first time (before a passcode exists); after that it requires the passcode to log in, not to
   set a new one.

### Notes

- **Single container, no external DB.** SQLite (WAL mode) is plenty for a team taking a
  quarterly/periodic test; there's no concurrent-write bottleneck at this scale. If you ever need
  multiple app replicas, swap SQLite for Coolify-managed Postgres — the SQLite bit is fully
  isolated in `lib/db.js`.
- **Backups.** Since all state lives in one SQLite file on the volume, back it up by copying
  `/app/data/app.db` off the volume periodically (Coolify supports scheduled backups on volumes,
  or run a cron/rsync from the host).
- **Admin session.** The admin cookie is an encrypted `iron-session` cookie (`SESSION_SECRET`),
  `httpOnly`, `secure` in production, 8-hour expiry. There's no separate session store, so it
  survives container restarts as long as `SESSION_SECRET` doesn't change.
- **Rate limiting** on `/api/officer/redeem` and `/api/admin/login` is in-memory and per-instance
  — fine for a single container, but resets on redeploy/restart.
